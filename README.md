## Portophilia

My personal portfolio of various projects over the years along with a blog that includes stories on my journey!

I have coined the term 'Portophilia' to reflect my admiration for the beautiful city of Porto, where I have recently relocated. The term also plays on the concept of 'portfolio', highlighting my work and showcasing my passion for both the city and my creative endeavors.
