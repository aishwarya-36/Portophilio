My first live coding interview as a developer was a humbling yet enlightening experience. Having watched hundreds of videos of others going through such interviews and rehearsed scenarios in my mind, I thought I was prepared. But when the moment arrived, reality was far from what I had envisioned. This was for a stealth startup ‚Äî yes, I didn't even know such companies existed until I encountered one and I won‚Äôt mention the name. 

Prior to the interview, I had completed a first-round chat with a recruiter, discussing my project background. The role appealed to me because of the work I did at Rampnow, which aligned closely with what they were looking for. Despite my preparation, nervousness crept in. I had gone through LeetCode problems, studied React documentation, and practiced coding in my head, but in that live setting, my mind felt a little blank. 

Having tried various frameworks and techstacks I had the fear that I might just have stepped foot on multiple things without really specializing in any. It made me question whether I could crack an interview if I didn‚Äôt have deep expertise in a specific area. The tech industry often emphasizes specialization, and it‚Äôs easy to feel inadequate when you don‚Äôt fit neatly into a single category. This fear is common among developers, especially those who are self-taught or have diverse interests. Maggie‚Äôs humor had also left a lasting impression. Once when asked whether he was a frontend or backend developer, he jokingly replied, ‚ÄúEdhuvume fulla theriyadha full-stack developer‚Äù‚Äîa full-stack developer who doesn‚Äôt really know anything fully. That honesty resonated deeply. It‚Äôs part of the journey, and sharing these moments reminds me that everyone‚Äôs path is a work in progress.

#### The Interview
The interview was structured into three parts: an introduction, a React problem, and a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problem using Python. The React question was straightforward, meant only to assess my basic understanding of React. Yet, for some odd reason, my brain slipped into debugging mode. I started scrutinizing the code, looking for what could be wrong. Without realizing it, I quickly changed the name of a parameter, something I knew was correct in the first place. The interviewer was incredibly kind and patient throughout. When asked what would happen when the button was clicked, I explained the scenario, only to realize how much I had jumped to conclusions and made a mistake. I owned up to it, reverted my change, and hoped my initial understanding wasn‚Äôt too badly affected.

As the interview progressed and we moved on to the DSA problem, I faced a familiar challenge. My experience with DSA is limited given that I‚Äôm self-taught without a formal degree in computer science. Concepts often seem more like abstract ideas rather than tangible skills I can immediately translate into code. To make things more challenging, the code was in Python, a language I‚Äôm not yet fully fluent in, though I can debug and look up syntax with ease. I mentioned this to the interviewer, and he reassured me that syntactical perfection wasn‚Äôt the main focus; he encouraged me to think aloud, ask questions, and communicate my thought process. 

I started off reasonably well, making one iteration of my solution before getting stuck. That‚Äôs when he asked if I knew what recursion was. I explained briefly that it‚Äôs when a function calls itself. Suddenly, the problem made more sense, and I tried to approach it recursively. I explained my next steps, but struggled to translate my thoughts into code. I froze. Despite his help, I was unable to find the right direction, and soon it was clear we were running out of time. 

In a moment of genuine kindness, the interviewer offered to teach me the solution‚Äî‚ÄúSince you're learning, I don‚Äôt want to leave you hanging like that,‚Äù he said. That gesture meant a lot to me. It was a reminder that, in the right environment, even a challenging interview can be a learning experience. I‚Äôve faced some rude interviews while in Singapore so this compassionate approach was a breath of fresh air. I left the session feeling grateful, not discouraged.

#### Takeaways

üí° One key insight I gained is how much I rely on tools like console logs and UIs to test my code. During school days, we wrote programs in notebooks and tested them in the "Computer Lab". Now, I realize this dependency has slowed my ability to mentally simulate what the code will do just by reading it. Moving forward, I want to reduce this reliance, sharpen my internal debugging skills, and get back to the fundamentals of understanding code logic without immediate visual feedback. 

üí° During the interview, I realized how easy it is to panic when you're stuck on a problem. I learned that staying calm and composed really helps you think more clearly. Moving forward, I want to practice keeping my cool under pressure so I can tackle challenges more effectively.

üí° I also discovered the importance of communicating my thought process clearly. Even if I don't arrive at the correct solution right away, articulating my approach and reasoning can show my problem-solving skills. It also makes it easier for the interviewer to guide me. I want to get better at thinking out loud and expressing my ideas confidently without worrying about sounding stupid.

While the interview didn‚Äôt go as I hoped and I worry that I may have missed a valuable opportunity, this experience has been a catalyst for growth. It‚Äôs motivated me to officially start learning computer science concepts‚Äîsomething I‚Äôve been meaning to do for a long time. <u><b> [TeachYourselfCS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)</b></u>  has been on my list, a treasure trove of resources for self-taught developers like me. 

On a lighter note, I found it amusing that the ‚ÄúWhy study Programming‚Äù section on that site was exactly what I needed to hear. Don‚Äôt be the person who ‚Äúnever quite understood‚Äù something like recursion. It felt as if the universe was mocking me.

Here‚Äôs to embracing the learning process, to continuous growth, and to becoming a better developer each day. Every experience, whether smooth or rocky, is a stepping stone. I look forward to the next chapter with curiosity and an open mind!üìà
