#### The AI Hype✨

When I first dipped my toes into web development, AI wasn’t the buzzword it is today. No one was panicking about AI stealing jobs or “build an app in a day with zero coding” headlines. Fast forward to when I was about to enter the job market as a junior dev—suddenly, the fear was real. Everywhere I looked, people were talking about AI replacing engineers overnight.

I’ll admit, it was intimidating. But after chatting with a few seasoned devs, I realized something crucial: AI isn’t here to replace us—it’s here to amplify us. Used right, it’s a game-changing productivity booster. Used wrong? Well, let’s just say you’ll spend more time untangling spaghetti code than actually building anything cool.

I started my journey the traditional way—docs, tutorials, and a lot of trial and error. No shortcuts, no magic AI wand. Only after I had my fundamentals locked in did I start experimenting with AI tools. And wow, I was impressed! The speed, the explanations, the way it “got” what I was trying to do—it felt like having a super-smart pair programmer.
As I moved from simple scripts to complex projects, I saw firsthand why experienced devs aren’t sweating AI. Behind every slick AI-generated solution, there’s often a mess waiting to be cleaned up. Sometimes, it’s faster (and saner) to just write the code yourself.

#### The Bootcamp Bubble 

I’ve met so many people who think a bootcamp or a “masterclass” is their golden ticket to a six-figure dev job. Spoiler: it’s not. The market is flooded with resumes from folks who skipped the hard work, thinking AI or a quick course would do the heavy lifting. But here’s the reality: if it were that easy, everyone would be a developer.
Recently, a friend asked why I was reading books on DSA and system design. “Why bother? AI can do it all!” Sure, AI can explain concepts, but can it debug your logic under pressure? Can it design scalable systems from scratch? Can it save you when the AI-generated code breaks in production? Nope. AI is a Tool, Not a Teacher.

💡If you’re considering a career in tech, here’s my advice:

- Learn the fundamentals. AI can’t think for you.
- Use AI to boost, not bypass. It’s not a replacement for skill. 
- Build real projects. Your portfolio is your proof.

#### Prompt Engineering: The Real Superpower 🦸‍♂️

I recently watched a video of a Stanford professor explain that you have to “use AI to use AI.” You can’t use Excel to learn Excel, right? It’s not about blindly copying outputs; it’s about crafting your prompts, refining your questions, and giving it the right context to get the answers you actually need.
And here’s another pro tip: not all AI models are created equal. Experimenting with different tools is key. For example, I’ve found that Claude is great for writing and reasoning through complex code, while GitHub Copilot (especially the free version) is great for quick fixes and syntax errors, but its models can be a bit basic for deeper problems. Each has its strengths, and knowing which to use and how can save you hours of frustration.
If you master the art of prompting, you’ll unlock a whole new level of productivity.

I like to think of myself as a “Prompt Engineer” now. Asking the right questions, guiding AI to give me what I actually need—it’s an art. But here’s the thing: AI doesn’t replace understanding. If your foundation is solid, AI makes you unstoppable.

The future belongs to those who understand the code, not just those who can generate it. So yes, embrace AI— but don’t let it fool you into skipping the grind. The best developers aren’t the ones who rely on AI; they’re the ones who know how to wield it.

Final Thought:
AI is like a power tool. In the right hands, it builds skyscrapers. In the wrong hands? It’s just a fancy hammer. Which one will you be? 🚀
