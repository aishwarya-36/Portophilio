Welcome to my _new blog_ about becoming a developer. Here, I will share my learning journey as I build my portfolio website.

#### How it all started

Ah, Singapore during the pandemic—an experience that felt like being stuck in a high-tech, densely populated bubble, where the outside world seemed just a little too close yet impossibly far. With the streets quieter than usual and the usual hustle and bustle replaced by a haunting stillness, it often felt like I was living in a dystopian novel. The isolation hit harder than a sudden downpour during monsoon season, and I found myself longing for adventure, a way out and a taste of normalcy.

It was during one of those long, introspective evenings, wrapped in my comfy blanket and sipping on a less-than-exciting cup of Japanese Green Tea, that I had a lightbulb moment. A friend, probably sensing my restlessness through the digital ether, suggested I pick up a hobby—something to keep my mind busy and my heart hopeful. “Why not try web development?” he said, half-joking, half-serious.

At first, I was skeptical. But curiosity got the better of me. I dove headfirst into the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, thinking it would just be a fun distraction. Little did I know, I was about to embark on a journey that would change my life in ways I never anticipated.

#### The Learning Curve: From Zero

The early days were like learning to ride a bicycle—a mix of exhilaration and frustration. My first attempts at building a website were hilariously bad. I mean, I’m talking about a layout that looked like a toddler’s art project gone rogue. But every time I hit “refresh” and saw my code come to life, something inside me sparked with excitement. It was like magic!

With every tutorial I completed, I could feel myself morphing from a coding novice into a budding web developer. I remember the joy of solving my first bug—an error that had me scratching my head for hours. When I finally found the solution, I felt like I had just solved a crime mystery. “Aha! paranthesis was missing!” I could practically hear the applause in my head.

#### Building Connections, Virtually

As I delved deeper into the realm of coding, I discovered an entire community of fellow learners and developers. Online forums and Discord servers became my new hangout spots, where I met people from all walks of life who were just as passionate about coding as I was. They shared tips, celebrated mini-victories, and even exchanged memes about coding struggles (because let’s be real, everyone can relate to the pain of a misplaced bracket).

Web development became my escape—a way to connect with others and transform my feelings of isolation into something creative and fulfilling. I found joy in collaborating on projects, and learning new frameworks endlessly. Who knew that coding could be such a fun activity?

#### From Hobby to Career: The Big Leap

As the months rolled by, my little hobby grew into a full-blown obsession. I found myself spending late nights experimenting with new frameworks, learning about responsive design. What started as a way to cope with loneliness morphed into a newfound passion that I couldn’t ignore.

Eventually, I made the exciting decision to transition from my previous career to pursue web development full-time. It was a leap of faith, but I felt ready. I wanted to create, innovate, and build digital experiences that could touch people’s lives—after all, if I could turn my pandemic blues into a career, then anything was possible!

#### The Fun Side of Coding

Let’s not forget the fun elements that come with being a web developer. From crafting quirky Easter eggs in my projects to designing visually stunning websites that make users go “wow,” every day feels like an adventure.
Now, as I sit here typing away, I can’t help but reflect on how a pandemic-induced hobby transformed my life. I went from feeling lost and alone to thriving in a field I never expected to love. So here’s to unexpected journeys, digital adventures, and the power of turning frustration into creativity.

If you’re feeling stuck or overwhelmed, remember: sometimes, all it takes is a little nudge from a friend and a willingness to try something new. Who knows? You might just find your own calling in the most unexpected of places.

Happy coding!
