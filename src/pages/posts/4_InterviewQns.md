The job application process—once a simple and straightforward affair of sending out a resume and crossing your fingers, now transformed into an elaborate quest that would normally be asked at an interview. Enter the latest trend: the long list of subjective and behavioral questions that make you feel like you’re not just applying for a job, but auditioning for a reality show.
All this even before knowing if their application is being reviewed by a human that is.
You know the type.
"Why does this job appeal to you?"

- "Describe a complex problem you've solved."

- "Can you share an example of a project where something went wrong?"

- “Describe a time you faced a difficult situation at work and how it shaped you.”

- “If you were a superhero, what would your power be?” (Spoiler alert: It’s definitely the ability to find a job without jumping through hoops.)

And that's not even the half of it. These questions, once reserved for interviews, now permeate the initial application stage, adding unnecessary pressure and anxiety for candidates. The pressure to craft the "perfect" answer to these subjective questions can also exacerbate anxiety among job seekers. Many candidates may find themselves spending an inordinate amount of time trying to decode what an employer is looking for to prove their worth before even getting a foot in the door. The last time I had to go through typing answers for such questions were during the lengthy hiring process of Canonical, which was at least after they acknowledged having gone through my profile and expressed interest in proceeding with the hiring process. 

While the intention behind these questions may be to gauge a candidate's personality and cultural fit, I firmly believe this trend to do it in the application stage is not only unnecessary but also detrimental to both job seekers and employers. Instead of fostering a culture that respects candidates’ time, they often create a scenario where applicants feel compelled to pour their hearts into responses that may never even be read. It is crucial to recognize the potential pitfalls of this trend by shifting the focus back to objective qualifications and relevant experiences.

Now, let’s be real. Are we in such a dire job market that we’re basically signing up for the psychological Olympics just to get a foot in the door? It certainly feels that way!
And yes, some might argue that this “effort” is a way to filter out the uncommitted. If you can’t muster the energy to write about your greatest triumphs and failures, do you really deserve the job? Well, my friends, I’d say it’s time to flip that narrative! Just because someone doesn’t want to spend their Saturday night crafting a lengthy answers about their teamwork skills doesn’t mean they’re not a fantastic employee. Maybe they just have better things to do—like binge-watching the latest season of their favorite show or perfecting their sourdough bread recipe. Priorities, am I right?

Let’s also not forget the irony of it all. The very companies that demand these lengthy applications often claim to value work-life balance and mental well-being. But here we are, pouring our hearts and souls into these questions like they’re the final round of a game show, praying for a chance to answer the classic “What’s your greatest weakness?”.

As we navigate this increasingly complex landscape, it's crucial to remember that the goal is to find a job, one that hopefully comes with a decent salary and a good work-life balance.
In the end, whether you’re facing the gauntlet of subjective questions or just sending in a resume, remember: you’re just applying for a job, - Not auditioning for the role of your life.

Happy applying, brave adventurers!
