![A woman building things in a Makerspace](../../assets/Lab.jpg)

When I first moved here, I was excited but also a bit adrift. Making friends was a challenge, and weekends were often spent at home or I sometimes went to the club with my husband, watching cricket matches. Now, don’t get me wrong, I used to enjoy watching cricket, but lately, I haven’t been keeping up with it as much. I still love the atmosphere at the stadium—it’s unbeatable! But when I’m at home, I find that the TV has better replay action, which makes it easier to appreciate the game.

I remember one particular outing to watch an international match between Spain and Portugal. I had high hopes, imagining the vibrant atmosphere of cricket matches back in India. What I didn’t expect was to feel like I was sitting in a library instead of a stadium. The commentary was barely audible, and the excitement I expected fizzled out like a deflated balloon.

But then, like a ray of sunshine on a cloudy day, I joined a tech networking group. It was here that Rufus found me, a fellow tech enthusiast who changed everything for me. When I mentioned my passion for electronics and building things, Rufus reached out to me and told me about a makerspace he was part of.

Turns out, a makerspace is like a playground for adults—filled with tools, gadgets, and the spirit of creation. Intrigued, I decided to check it out one Tuesday, and it was like stepping into a wonderland! It was everything I wished I had during my college days when I was trying to build stuff at home with Zorty.

When I arrived, only a handful of people were there, and they were all busy working on various projects. Rufus graciously took me on a tour of the space, showcasing the 3D printers, laser cutting machines, power tools, and soldering stations. I felt like a kid in a candy store, excitement bubbling up inside me.

As I mingled with the friendly crowd, I realized that it didn’t matter that I wasn’t working on my own project. The joy of collaboration and learning from others was intoxicating. I found myself diving into group projects, sharing ideas, and soaking up knowledge like a sponge. For the first time in a long while, I looked forward to Tuesdays! Can you believe that? A weekday to look forward to - didn't think that was even possible!

The makerspace rekindled a flame I thought had long extinguished when I moved to Singapore. I had been convinced that my love for building and creating was a thing of the past. But now, with each session, I rediscovered that beautiful feeling of making something from scratch, of creating with my own hands.

Stay tuned, dear readers! I have a treasure trove of projects and experiences to share about my time at the makerspace. From quirky inventions to collaborative creations, there's so much to talk about! (Although, unfortunately, I don’t have a subscribe button yet, so just remember to come back later for more tales of my maker adventures!)

Until next time, keep creating and exploring! Who knows what you might rediscover in your own backyard?
