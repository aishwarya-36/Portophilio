For as long as I can remember, I’ve loved animals, especially dogs. 🐾✨
I once had a cat during my college days, who taught me that even the seemingly selfish graces of feline friends can hold a special place in our hearts. His name was Meowth, and even though I wasn’t typically fond of cats, my heart went out to him. He was different — strayed alone by his siblings, with two hind legs paralyzed, yet he had the cutest, most expressive eyes. 

There was something truly magical about the way he would come running from wherever he was when I came home. It created a wonderful feeling of connection that echoed the loyalty of dogs. Unfortunately, due to his condition, Meowth didn’t live long, and I found myself crying for days after his passing. 

My love for dogs solidified after I watched "Marley and Me"— what a rollercoaster of a film! It left me with a heart busting at the seams, yearning for a furry friend (that too a Golden Retriever) to call my own. Oddly enough, I could watch ruthless killing and bloodshed in movies for hours and remain unfazed, yet the thought of hurting an animal would bring me to tears. 

Fast forward to my epic staycation at San's place in lovely Maarssen, where the real fun began! They have a vivacious little toy poodle named Coco who’s been stealing hearts since the days when we both lived in Singapore. Coco is not just a dog; he’s a spirited bundle of joy, a whirlwind of energy who could turn even a rainy day into a smile-filled adventure! And, as if that weren't enough, he also has a nickname, "Furry and Ferocious"!

It was a staycation I’ll cherish for a long time—like a little slice of paradise right at home! I finally had the chance to binge-watch my favorite series, indulge in movies I’d been wanting to see, and cook all the delicious foods I love. And guess what? Coco was right there with me, always following my every move.

Initially, I thought spending over two weeks would be a solo affair with just Netflix and snacks as my company—but I was so wrong. Instead of loneliness, I found an endless stream of laughter and companionship with my four-legged furry buddy. Our daily routine: I’d water the plants (because, you know, adulting), then we’d set off on our morning quest to conquer the park — Coco strutting like he owned the joint while I struggled to keep up with his little paws! Work would call me back to my desk, and Coco? Oh, he’d just plop down beside me, a silent guardian of productivity. His presence was like a warm hug, and the best part? He’d follow me around the house as if to say, “I’m right here, human!” It filled me with such joy. 

Meals became a delightful bonding moment, with Coco being the most South Indian dog I’ve ever met. This little pooch had taste! He loved digging into idlies and pongal, with a little Sambar on top, of course. I couldn’t resist offering him a bite here and there. And then, it was playtime! With his trusty toy, he’d bring it to me and we’d engage in our epic fetch battles. Spoiler alert: Coco always won, I could never match his energy (Vayasaidchu, my lord)!

When the workday ended, Coco was always ready to leap into action like a furry superhero—he just knew it was time for our next park adventure. His excitement was contagious; you could practically see the joy radiating from his adorable little face.

Ah, but there was a mystery to unravel: the very first night, I couldn’t quite figure out why Coco kept switching between my room and the other room like he was playing hide and seek. It was like a puzzle! I finally cracked the code when I realized his bed was in the other room. Oops! So, I moved it to my room, and just like that, he snuggled in peacefully, dreaming of all the adventures we’d embark on.

This staycation wasn’t my first cozy time with Coco — I’d had a shorter version back in Singapore when the rest of the family was off on vacation. But this two-week escapade? It was sheer bliss! Each wag of Coco’s tail filled my heart with happiness, and with every lazy afternoon spent together, it became clear: this was all I ever wanted in life.

I still catch myself hearing the faint jingle of his collar and it instantly brings a smile—and a little twinge of heartache—because those quiet moments with him made everything even sweeter. 

Dogs have an incredible way of enriching our lives, turning ordinary moments into extraordinary memories. Honestly, I wish every place was dog-friendly so Coco could have been part of all our adventures outside too. Being with Coco filled my heart with a love I never knew I needed, and I can’t wait for our next adventure. 

So, if you ever find yourself contemplating a staycation, I highly recommend snagging a furry companion. Trust me, they’ll make every moment worth it! 🐶 Here’s to more staycation memories and the simple pleasures of home!💖
