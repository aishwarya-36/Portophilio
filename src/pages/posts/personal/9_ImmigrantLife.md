For years, the narrative was simple: move abroad, build a career, and chase the promise of a better life. But what happens when the cost of staying becomes too high—not just in money, but in dignity, in freedom, in the things that truly matter? Recently, as new H1-B rules and global uncertainty have left many immigrants questioning their futures, I’ve seen more people making the bold choice to leave. I was one of them.
My decision to leave Singapore wasn’t just about escaping a pandemic or a restrictive visa. It was about reclaiming control over my own life. People often asked me, “Why would you leave such a great place?” The answer isn’t simple, but it starts with a question: What does “great” really mean when your sense of belonging is always conditional?

#### The Dream and the Detour
In my final year of engineering, buried in projects and deadlines, I decided to pursue a master’s degree. It wasn’t just about better education or exposure—it was about passion. I wanted to dive deeper into electronics, to push my limits. At the time, the options were clear: an IT job in India, or a shot at something bigger abroad.
I applied to universities in Germany, the US, and Singapore. The US was daunting—sky-high tuition, a mountain of debt, and the prospect of years spent pinching pennies. Singapore, on the other hand, offered subsidies, lower costs, and proximity to home. NUS, ranked in the top ten for my field, felt like the natural choice. I never looked back.
Graduate life in Singapore was everything I hoped for and more. I made lifelong friends, explored new cultures, and grew in ways I hadn’t imagined. I never once regretted not going to the US.

#### The Pandemic: A Pause and a Reckoning
Then, the world stopped. The pandemic forced us all to confront what truly mattered. For two years, Singapore’s borders were sealed. Locals could leave and return after quarantine, but for immigrants, leaving meant risking everything—jobs, visas, the lives we’d built. It felt like a cruel double standard, one that exposed the fragility of our place in the country.
The racism that surfaced during the Delta variant outbreak was something I never expected in Singapore. Friends lost jobs for attending family emergencies. One friend’s mother passed away, and he couldn’t go home without sacrificing his career. My own mother faced a serious health crisis, and I couldn’t be there. When I spoke to my manager, her empathy was merely in words, her warnings thinly veiled threats: “If you leave, you might not be able to come back.” With each passing day it made me sick to my stomach to be living there.
I realized how little control I had over external factors: the economy, layoffs, and visa policies. The only thing I could control was my response. Settling in SG was never the plan, I only intended to stay a few years as I traveled and explored places in SEA, before I made a move to a bigger country. Every day, I asked myself: Am I here for the visa? For the money? Or for something more? whether I wanted my career dictated by a visa. 

#### The Breaking Point
By October, I knew I had to leave. I started packing my things, box by box, as a way to keep my sanity. Each packed item was a small act of defiance, a reminder that I was taking back control.
When paati passed away, I could only take a day off to grieve. That was the final straw. I told my manager I was leaving, no matter what. After escalations and negotiations, I was granted permission to work from India—on the condition that I renew my visa for another five years. So it was possible afterall! Desperation is the father of compromise. I went home for a month and a half, but my mind was made up: I was done.
When I resigned, my manager tried to convince me to stay, insisting things would get better. But it wasn’t about lockdowns or pandemics. It was about principles. It was about living in a place that treated me as disposable, where my worth was tied to a piece of paper.

#### Freedom in the Choice to Leave
The new American dream—or any dream, really—isn’t about staying in a country at all costs. It’s about using the skills, networks, and savings you’ve built to create a life where you’re not at the mercy of visas, layoffs, or politics. For me, that meant returning home, building something of my own, and embracing the freedom that comes with it.
Leaving Singapore wasn’t a failure. It was a choice. It was about prioritizing my values over my visa, my family over my paycheck, and my peace of mind over prestige. It’s made me stronger, more resilient, and confident that I can build a future anywhere—especially at home.
Not everyone will understand this decision, and that’s okay. Each of us has our own priorities, our own definitions of success. For me, freedom isn’t just a place. It’s the power to choose where—and how—I live.
