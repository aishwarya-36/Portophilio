        <h2>... and my developer journey!</h2>
        <h3> Welcome to My Digital Playground!</h3>
        <p> Hey there! I'm {identity.firstName} (aka Aishu), a {identity.occupation} at {identity.company} based in the sun-kissed streets of Porto,{identity.country}, where the pastries are sweeter than me (and trust me, that‚Äôs pretty sweet!). 
        <br> <br>
        When I‚Äôm not busy crafting pixel-perfect web applications, you can find me binge-watching movies, geeking out over the latest anime series, or plotting my next adventure to a far-off land‚Äîbecause what's better than debugging code? Debugging code while sipping tea in a cozy caf√© in Tokyo, of course!
        <br> <br>
        With a passion for turning ideas into code and a love for storytelling, I create web experiences that are as engaging as a plot twist in your favorite film. So grab some popcorn, scroll through my portfolio, and let‚Äôs embark on a tech journey that‚Äôs bound to be more exciting than a giant robot battle! üé¨‚ú®‚úàÔ∏è</p>
		<p>My skills are:</p>
		<ul>
		{skills.map((skill) => <li class="text-[#0f0cc7c5]">{skill}</li>)}
		</ul>
